Gmail Spam Detection

A machine learning project that detects spam emails using NLP and TF-IDF vectorization.

Project Overview
- Developed a spam classifier to detect and filter malicious emails in real-time.
- Applied text cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
- Built a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Streamlit

Steps to Run

1.Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

2.Train the model

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook gmail_spam_detection.ipynb

This will create models/spam_classifier.pkl and models/vectorizer.pkl.

3. Run the web app
streamlit run app.py


Then open http://localhost:8501
 in browser.

Results

Achieved around 97–98% accuracy with Logistic Regression.

Handles spam, phishing, and promotional emails effectively.

Example Inputs
Example Email	Prediction
"Congratulations! You won a lottery!"	Spam 
"Hey, are we meeting today at 5?"	Not Spam 



6. How to Run Everything (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ Open your folder `Gmail-Spam-Detection` in VS Code or Jupyter.  
2️⃣ Make sure dataset is saved as `data/spam.csv` (downloaded from Kaggle).  
3️⃣ Open notebook `gmail_spam_detection.ipynb` → Run all cells.  
   - It will train and save `spam_classifier.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`.  
4️⃣ Then open terminal and type:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
5️⃣ A browser tab opens. Paste an email, click Predict, and see result 🚀.
